# Selftember - A month focused on reflection and personal improvement

# Welcome!
## Selftember is a month-long event where you are encouraged to take time for yourself if you haven't already or if you already are in the habit, to re-examine your methods and see if there is something which should be adjusted.

You're all highly encouraged to [submit issues](https://github.com/alexwykoff/selftember/issues) if you find errors or would like to suggest enhancements.

If you have something you would like to add, [file a pull request](https://github.com/alexwykoff/selftember/pulls) and share your talents!

New material will be added daily throughout the month, so be sure to keep checking in.
